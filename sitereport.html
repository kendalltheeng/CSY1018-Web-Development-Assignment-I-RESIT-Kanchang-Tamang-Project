        <h1>My Knowledge learning Web Development.</h1>
        <p>I've always loved discovering new information.I'm also really interested in computers and coding.A UX designer is what I aim to be.<br>I am enhancing my knowledge and skills as a result whenever I have the chance.I have had a lot of opportunities to study new things since I joined NAMI College. One of them is being capable of learning web design. Web design is a course that I believe to be highly intriguing.Being given the chance to learn about web development and create websites has been enjoyable because it is such an important aspect of the internet. I had a rollercoaster of emotions while learning this module, however everytime I ran into troubles, my module instructor Mr. Chirag Thapa sir was there to assist me.<br>while coding.During his absence, I looked for assistance online as well.Coding was initially pretty challenging for me, but over time, I warmed up to it.While building the navbar, I had a lot of difficulties, but fortunately, Chirag Sir was able to help me and I was able to solve the issue.I have learnt the fundamentals of coding and programming in this subject, and my assignment has helped me further my understanding of web development.I learned everything there is to know about HTML and CSS in this module.Everyone can create a career out of it with more skill, practice, knowledge, elation, and commitment, in my opinion.Although web design can be a challenging concept to grasp, once you get the hang of it, it is a really enjoyable and exciting field to study.</p>
        <h1>Creating the homepage</h1>
        <p>Because the first impressions are always lasting, a website's homepage serves as its public face.Though I kept it straightforward, I tried to give it a touch of elegance.
